                <h2>Our Founding</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Gilbert, the creator of QuickRecap. This platform was born out of my passion for deepening
                    our understanding of the world by uncovering the rich origins and native knowledge that shape who we
                    are today. I believe that history and culture hold the keys to understanding the present, and my goal
                    is to share this perspective with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    QuickRecap is designed to go beyond the surface. Unlike other platforms that offer general
                    information, we take pride in diving into the roots of cultures, traditions, and historical events.
                    When you search for a topic, like the Philippines, youâ€™ll discover not just the facts, but the
                    stories, customs, and wisdom passed down through generations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created QuickRecap to provide a place where authentic and native knowledge is celebrated and preserved. By exploring the origins of things, we aim to spark curiosity and appreciation for the diversity and richness of the world we live in.
